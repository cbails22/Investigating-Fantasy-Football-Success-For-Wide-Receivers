Title: Evaluating Wide Receiver Performance in Fantasy Football

## Abstract: 
Fantasy football is a multi-billion dollar industry and has become an integral part of the season for both casual and die-hard football fans. This popularity has led to an increase in the use of data to gain an edge over the competition. I am focusing on data related to the position of wide receiver with the goal of finding new metrics that accurately predict future fantasy football performance. 

## Context:
The stakes in Fantasy Football can be very high. Whether it is professionals playing for huge prizes or just your average football enthusiast playing for bragging rights, players are always engaged and want to win ...badly. One common problem is when players fall short of their expectations. On the flipside, there are players who exceed expectations. Oftentimes, there are obvious reasons for why one or the other happens such as injuries or a change at the quarterback position leading to more or less success. Other times, however, there can be more underlying issues that may have pointed to or contributed to success (or lack thereof).

There is always some amount of “luck” involved in Fantasy Football. However, with so much data and player evaluation metrics now at our disposal, Fantasy players rely heavily on projections to help them craft their rosters. Projections are extremely hard and no one can get them right all the time. But, it is important for the Fantasy Football community to have people who are dedicated to doing their best at making accurate projections for players. 

## Proposal:
I intend to investigate wide receiver data. One reason this is interesting is because wide receivers are the largest position in terms of quantity in Fantasy Football. They are also some of the most influential players, and targeting the right/wrong receivers can make or break the chances of winning your league. The main question that I am trying to answer is: What are the biggest predictors of success for wide receivers in Fantasy Football? Based on these predictors, who are some wide receivers that players should target or stay away from in drafts for next season?

I plan on using wide receiver data from past seasons to find correlations with fantasy performance in terms of points. From there, I hope to take the results from the correlation tests to identify players who performed well/poorly in these metrics and compare them with the amount of fantasy points these players scored last season. I also plan on running regression models to attempt to answer some of the same questions. My analysis will be done predominantly in R. 

I expect to find that there were a fair share of wide receivers who either outperformed their ability or vice versa. These players would then presumably be due for negative or positive regression to the mean for the upcoming season. My initial prediction is that wide receiver targets/target share percentage is going to be the biggest indicator of fantasy points scored. I also hope to be able to use what I find for my own Fantasy Football drafts in the upcoming season. 

## Conclusion:
Over and under performance is often an issue in Fantasy Football. Success in one season does not guarantee success in another, and the same goes for the reverse. It is important for Fantasy Football players to have access to projections that are backed up by what the data says. I plan to use data in order to assess wide receiver performance and find receivers that Fantasy players should either target or steer clear from in the 2022 season. 

This project has the potential to be expanded in the future. I could look at all the other positions in the Fantasy Football player pool as well (Quarterbacks, Running Backs, Tight Ends). It would be interesting to look at the different metrics that predict success for other positions than wide receivers, in the future.
